## Content

This course introduces the fundamental techniques for a range of tasks in natural language processing (NLP), with a particular focus on statistical approaches. We will consider tasks that involve hierarchical structure (e.g., syntactic trees) and/or hidden structure (e.g., in semantic tasks), using supervised and some unsupervised statistical learning algorithms. The course aims to explain the potential and the main limitations of these techniques, as well as discussing them in the wider context of current research issues in NLP and its real-world applications. 

The lectures will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to NLP and its applications
- Morphological processing
- Language models
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Context-free grammars and syntactic parsing 
- Lexical and distributional semantics
- Neural language models and word embeddings 
- Compositional semantics and sentence representations 
- Discourse processing 
- Dialogue modelling 
- Language generation and summarization
- Machine translation
- Interpretability of NLP models
- Large language models (aka foundation models)


An important component of the course is a hands-on practical, in which the students will have the opportunity to implement a number of language processing methods and perform experiments on a real-world task: sentiment analysis of movie reviews. The hands-on-practical consists of two parts and will be completed in teams of two. You can find the link to the team registration form on the Canvas home page of this course.
